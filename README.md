# Responsive Web Design - Client Osteopathic Website

### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

This repo contains *Sharon Cheng - Osteopathic Care*.  This website was a client project for a small business who wanted to have some digital precesnse for self promotion. The site has not gone live for the client, as the content has not yet been provided. As such, some areas still contain lorem ipsum standin text.

The given tasks included:

*	Creating a responsive and mobile friendly website
*	Displaying info about the practitioner, services, misssion, referrals and contact info
*	Branding - logo design done by myself
*	Headshots - photography for headshots done by myself: [Tami McInnis Photography](www.tamimcinnis.com "Tami McInnis Photography")

This project was built using HTML, CSS, Jquery and Bootstrap.

All photography with the exception of the client headshots is free for commercial use stock photography.
